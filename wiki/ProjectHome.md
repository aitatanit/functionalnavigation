## Introduction ##

Our primary objective is to deliver a software testbed that helps a user to define optimal for a specific navigation problem by selecting components from a library of dynamic models and sensing algorithms. This testbed also offers a library of trajectory optimization algorithms that can be used to solve navigation problems. We do not guarantee that any single component will be the best in its class, but this framework makes it easy to swap out one component for another and compare their performance.
